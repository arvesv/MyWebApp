## A testproject for Web development using .NET, Github Actions and more

The plan is that this should be a long lived (!) .NET Web project at least deployable to 
Google Cloud Run. It will be used to try different consepts, all while working what GitHub offers.

Short term goals are:
* Setup Continous Deployment to everything like Cloud Run, local K8S, fly.io and more
* Do proper secret management (this project is public)
* Add a social login
